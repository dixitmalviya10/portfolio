          About Me
        </h1>
        <p>
          Passionate and dedicated graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer
          Application from Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Open University. My journey in
          the world of technology took an exciting turn during my academic
          years, as I discovered a strong interest in web development. Eager to
          explore this field further, I joined a web development training
          academy where I had the privilege of learning from experienced
          mentors.

        <p>
          Upon completing my academic studies, I delved deeper into the core
          frontend aspects of web development, and expanded my skill set to
          include trending and powerful tools such as React.js for building
          dynamic user interfaces, as well as Git and GitHub for effective
          version control and collaboration. In my first year, I attended a
          workshop that showed how to make projects like the ones used in real
          companies and get noticed by top tech firms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Motivated by a strong desire to learn, I always look for new
          technologies and coding languages that make me better at web
          development. I truly trust that coding well can make digital
          experiences smooth. As I start this journey, I'm eager to use my
          skills for projects that excite me, aiming to stay updated in this
          fast-changing field.
